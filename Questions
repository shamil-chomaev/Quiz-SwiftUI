I think the most important question for me right now is how to present and dismiss views. I have tried using a NavigationLink, but that didn't work at all.
Forthermore one of the things I would like to know is how "hacky" the way is I changed the background color of the view.
Of course as always any additional feedback is always welcome. :-)
There will be more questions in the future, but if I get this one working already I can already figure out a lot of things on my own.
